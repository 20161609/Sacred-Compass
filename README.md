An app designed for Korean users to easily find and display English Bible verses in a large, readable format for effective Bible study.

# Sacred Compass

## Description

Although I am Korean, I started copying the English Bible to study English. However, there were a lot of difficult and unfamiliar words, and it was not easy to control the English Bible because it was so large and I had to copy it. Simply, I created an app that allows you to copy through the device's screen output and view the translated text below in Korean, my native language.

## Features

- Easily search and display English Bible verses.
- View the English verses in a large, readable format.
- See the corresponding Korean translations below each verse.
- Optimized for English Bible study, specifically for Korean users.
